            Fish represent a broad class of aquatic animals that can live in
            fresh or saltwater, depending on the species. Bringing fish into
            your home can be an exciting hobby, especially if you intend to
            breed them, and the presence of a fish tank in your home can induce
            feelings of peace and tranquility.

            maintaining your aquarium, it is important to test your water{' '}
            <b>once per week</b> to ensure it is free from toxins that can harm

            your fish will get along! No matter the species, ensure your fish
            are suited for a freshwater environment by investing in a water
            testing kit. Follow these general water chemistry guidelines to
            ensure your fish will adapt well to your aquarium and avoid
            ingesting toxins that can harm or kill your fish:
            <ul>
              <li>pH Level: 6.8–7.6 (7.0 is considered neutral)</li>
              <li>Ammonia: any level above zero is harmful to fish</li>
              <li>Nitrates: 5 to 10 ppm</li>
              <li>Nitrites: less than 0.5 ppm</li>

              {' '}
              <li>Salinity: 1.020–1.028 sg</li>{' '}
              <li>pH Level: 7.6–8.4 (7.0 is considered neutral)</li>
              <li>Ammonia: any level above 0.1 ppm requires attention</li>
              <li>Nitrates: 10 to 40 ppm • Nitrites: less than 0.2 ppm</li>
